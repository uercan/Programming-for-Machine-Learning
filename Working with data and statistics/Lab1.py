"""
-min function returns the minimum value of an array

-max function returns the maximum value of an array

-mean function returns the mean value of a set of numbers, so the average number calculated by a normal average 

-variance function returns the variance of a set of numbers, it basically tells us how spread is the data that we are working with
the more spread the data is, the larger this value will be

Standard deviation tells you how spread out the data is. It is a measure of how far each observed value is from the mean.
In any distribution, about 95% of values will be within 2 standard deviations of the mean
